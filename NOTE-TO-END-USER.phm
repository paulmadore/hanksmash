GitHub is mostly meant for developers, and can be confusing to non-developers. To simplify things, if you just want to download a zip file containing HankSmash, look to your lower-right (as of the User Interface on 12 June 2014) and click the button that says "download zip file." Unlike SourceForge, the other place where this program is hosted, GitHub will simply process your download request immediately. Thank you so much for downloading!
